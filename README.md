# Advanced Modern Elevator System

The Modern Elevator System is a robust and feature-rich elevator script designed for use in role-playing game modes. This script is built to work seamlessly with both ESX and QBCore, two of the most widely used frameworks in the GTA V role-playing community. It also requires the use of the `ox_lib` resources to function properly.

## Features

- **Elevator UI**: The script provides a modern and intuitive user interface for interacting with the elevators. This includes the ability to select a destination floor, view the current floor, and close the elevator UI.

- **Floor Selection**: The script supports multiple floors for each elevator, each with its own unique properties such as level, coordinates, and access restrictions.

- **Access Control**: Elevator access can be restricted based on the player's job. If a player does not have the necessary job, they will be denied access to certain floors.

- **Customization**: The script is highly customizable, allowing server owners to easily add new elevators, floors, and adjust various settings to suit their server's needs.

## Requirements

- **ESX or QBCore**: The script is designed to work with either the ESX or QBCore framework. It uses the `es_extended` or `qb-core` resource to interact with player data.

- **ox_lib**: The `ox_lib` resource is required for the script to function. It provides essential functionality for the script, such as handling notifications and progress bars.

## Installation

To install the Modern Elevator System, simply add the `kedi_elevator` folder to your server's resources directory and ensure that the `ox_lib` resources are also installed. Then, add `start kedi_elevator` to your server.cfg file.

## Usage

Players can interact with the elevators by approaching them and pressing the 'E' key. This will open the elevator UI, allowing the player to select a destination floor. If the player does not have access to a certain floor, they will be notified and denied access.
